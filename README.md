### What You‚Äôll Need to prepare my sweet *Mimie Instant Noodles (Chicken Flavor)* are: üçú

- 6 or 4 pack of **Mimie Instant Noodles (Chicken Flavor)**
- 1 cups of **water** and small **oil**
- A **small pot or big if its a lot** 
- **onion**
- **peppers**
- and anyother thing you would like to add to it 
-  well this Optional: An **egg** like 3 or 2, some **veggies** (like carrots, peas), or a sweet **sliced chicken** for extra flavor or you  can just use egg alone

### So this my Step-by-Step:

1. **Boil Water and add your small oil:**
   - Pour **2 cups of water** into a small pot and bring it to a  boil on medium heat and add **1 spone of  oil, onion, peppers etc** into it or you can fry the onions and peppers before Pouring, either way, you can fry or boil* it .

2. **Add the Noodles:**
   - Open the Mimie noodles pack and drop the noodles block into the boiling hot water/oil.
   - Let it cook for about **2 minutes** or **3 minutes**. Stir occasionally to help it separate and to keep it from burning.

3. **Add the Seasoning:**
   - Open the seasoning sachet (chicken flavor) from the pack.
   - Pour the seasoning into the pot and stir well to distribute the flavor and make sure the water is a bit dry so it would bring out the sweetness with the oil .

4. **Cook for 1 More Minutes:**
   - Continue to cook the noodles for another **1 or 1/2 minutes**, stirring occasionally.
   - The noodles should become soft and absorb the seasoning. oh you will enjoy it .

5. ** so this is Optional Add-ons:**
   - If you want to add extra ingredients like an egg, crack it directly into the boiling noodles and stir gently or you can boil the egg into another pot.
   - You can also add sliced vegetables or cooked chicken for more flavor and nutrition or fish .

6. **Serve and Enjoy it:**
   - Once the noodles are cooked, turn off the heat.
   - Transfer the noodles to a bowl and enjoy your hot, delicious **Mimie Chicken Flavor Noodles**! and you can add more peppers  into it that if you like hot noodles like me
